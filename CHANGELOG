[3.7.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed backupRequest function to receive the correct variable

[3.5.2014]
    Modified..: Setup script updated to add xvfb package so EyeWitness can run in a headless install. Thanks to baptistedonaux for letting me know and @themightyshiv for testing it out. Github Issue #13

[3.2.2014]
    Modified..: Server header responses are now properly decoded from unicode rather than just stripping the u' from the string.  Thanks to Ian Gallagher for pointing this out - Github Issue #3
    Modified..: Updated setup script to use a specific known working commit of Ghost, to prevent any potential future breaks in functionality.

[3.1.2014]
    Modified..: Did a major cleanup of code structure.  Largely needed to not have duplicate code all over EyeWitness when implementing usage of scanning a single URL via a command line argument.
    Added.....: --single for use to scan a single URL - thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for requesting this, it should have been added in the first place - Github Issue #7
    Added.....: Aliased -h, -?, --h, -help, and --help to all produce the help menu if passed in as a parameter.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for the suggestion. - Github Issue #8
    Modified..: Stopped stripping "http://", "https://", and "www" from URLs.  Only stripping "//", ":", and "/" now.  This is due to a logic flaw identified by Robin Wood (@digininja) that would cause images to be overwritten based off the URLs provided. - Github Issue #9
    Added.....: Check to see if URL provided starts with "http://" or "https://", and if not, default to adding "http://" to the front of the url so ghost can resolve it.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for suggesting this. - Github Issue #6
