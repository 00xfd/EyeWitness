[3.24.2014]
    Modified..: Completed user agent switching.  It detects differences in requests from the baseline request based off of html source length.  If beyond a difference of 50 in length between the new request and the baseline, it will add the new useragent request to the report.

[3.20.2014]
    Added.....: Began working on adding user agent switching capabilities

[3.18.2014]
    Added.....: The user can now use the --useragent flag and provide a useragent to be used for all requests.
    Modified..: Location of folder creating function moved outside of if statements.
    Modified..: User now able to skip sleep by Ctrl+C during sleep of --jitter
    Modified..: Location of log file (which is used to detect SSL certificate errors) was moved into folder of the running EyeWitness report, to ensure more than one instance of EyeWitness can be running simultaneously.

[3.15.2014]
    Added.....: Detection of websites using invalid SSL certificates
    Modified..: Setup script to use my modified Ghost library which allows the user to navigate to sites with invalid SSL certs (but also logs a warning).

[3.14.2014]
    Added.....: Jitter functionality added in. If using -jitter <# of seconds>, it will randomize the URL list, and sleep between requests for a value of <# of seconds> - 30% of Num seconds provided
    Modified..: Found potential issue with default creds function being called in the wrong location
    Modified..: Moved instantiation of Ghost object
    Modified..: EyeWitness can now be called from any location - Github Issue #18
    Modified..: Changed variables to be multi-line strings (where applicable) - Github Issue #17
    Modified..: Slightly changed help menu, if no file provided, EyeWitness help screen is shown
    Modified..: Added ability to name output directory with -d switch - Github Issue #19
    Modified..: Fixed bug in nmap xml parser that would happen if "tunnel" value didn't exist

[3.8.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed issue where providing EyeWitness with 1025+ URLs would cause the process to hit its file descriptor limit.  Issue has been fixed. - Github Issue # 15

[3.7.2014]
    Modified..: Fixed backupRequest function to receive the correct variable
    Modified..: Files being opened are now done properly

[3.5.2014]
    Modified..: Setup script updated to add xvfb package so EyeWitness can run in a headless install. Thanks to baptistedonaux for letting me know and @themightyshiv for testing it out. Github Issue #13

[3.2.2014]
    Modified..: Server header responses are now properly decoded from unicode rather than just stripping the u' from the string.  Thanks to Ian Gallagher for pointing this out - Github Issue #3
    Modified..: Updated setup script to use a specific known working commit of Ghost, to prevent any potential future breaks in functionality.

[3.1.2014]
    Modified..: Did a major cleanup of code structure.  Largely needed to not have duplicate code all over EyeWitness when implementing usage of scanning a single URL via a command line argument.
    Added.....: --single for use to scan a single URL - thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for requesting this, it should have been added in the first place - Github Issue #7
    Added.....: Aliased -h, -?, --h, -help, and --help to all produce the help menu if passed in as a parameter.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for the suggestion. - Github Issue #8
    Modified..: Stopped stripping "http://", "https://", and "www" from URLs.  Only stripping "//", ":", and "/" now.  This is due to a logic flaw identified by Robin Wood (@digininja) that would cause images to be overwritten based off the URLs provided. - Github Issue #9
    Added.....: Check to see if URL provided starts with "http://" or "https://", and if not, default to adding "http://" to the front of the url so ghost can resolve it.  Thanks to Robin Wood (@digininja) for suggesting this. - Github Issue #6

    Released..: EyeWitness Initial 1.0 Release
